# Alternative_combiner

This Alternative combiner is basically a C++ code, which has the sole purpose of combining two txt files line by line alternatively
in a way such as:


file1.txt   
line1                                 
  line2                                 
  line3                                 
  line4             
	_______________

file2.txt   
a                                 
  b                                 
  c                                 
  d             


*************************

	 The result ( file3.txt )
	 
	 line1
	 a
	 line2
	 b
	 line3
	 c
	 line4
	 d
	 .
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 	# The code is kinda messy, but does the job. Feel free to use and alter as you like.
